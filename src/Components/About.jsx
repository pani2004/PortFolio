            Hello! I'm Debashis Pani, a B.Tech student in Information Technology (5th semester), with a passion for open-source contributions and web development. Recently, I participated in the GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC'24), where I secured an All India Rank of 78, with 49 merged PRs. I am proficient in the MERN stack, AWS, and have experience working with tools like Kafka and Nginx.

            I'm actively involved in the AWS Cloud Club and CyberPeace Corps societies at my college, contributing to the web teams of both. Currently, Iâ€™m working on developing a PACS server to aid radiologists in the healthcare sector, combining my interest in technology and its real-world applications.
